# Prompt-Framework-Lab
A personal practice repository for improving prompt engineering using the CRAFT, MARKETER, 4C’s, and Few-Shot prompting frameworks.

The prompt scenarios are based on all the fields( healthcare, finance, e-commerce, education, travel, HR, software/QA, marketing, real estate, hospitality) 
I am using chatGPT free version for prompting 

# Purpose of This Repo
* Build daily prompt-writing consistency
* Practice structured prompt engineering
* Improve scenario-based prompting
* Maintain a clean library of examples for interviews and projects

# Frameworks I Practice Here
* CRAFT Framework - Clean structure + task breakdown

1. C- clarify- define the task clearly 
2. R- Role- Assign AI a role/Persona 
3. A- Act - specify what action to perform
4. F- Form- define the output format
5. T- Test- refine and iterate 


* MARKETER Framework - CTA, value, audience targeting

1. M- market- define the product
2. A- Audience - who is it for?
3. R- Reason- why should they care?
4. K-Keywords- must-use terms
5. E-Execution- channel/medium (FB,INSTA,LinkedIn, Email,Print)
6. T- Tone- voice & style (playful, persuasive,formal)
7. E- Evaluation- success criteria (A/B test, engagement,conversions)
8. R-Refinement - Iteration after testing

* 4 C’s Prompting - Clarity + Context + Constraints + Creativity
* Few-Shot Prompting - Add examples + variations

These frameworks helps us: 
- how to design prompts
- how to structure them
- how to adjust tone
- how to guide the model
- how to generate consistent outputs

I will use all together based on the scenarios I am covering in this repository
